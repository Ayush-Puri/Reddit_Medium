# Reddit-Medium Hybrid Platform (Microservices Architecture)

## Overview
This project is a **Reddit + Medium-inspired platform** that enables users to submit projects, post discussions, comment, and interact with other users in a microservices architecture. The platform is built using **Spring Boot, Spring WebFlux, and Microservices**, ensuring scalability, performance, and efficiency.

## Status 
- Monolith 85 % Finish âœ… (Elasticsearch addition remaining), Microservices Archietecture Update - Inter-Service API Gateway setup in progress (Including Security and maintaining Data Integrity)

## Key Features
- **Modular Microservices Architecture**: The platform is designed with separate services for:
  - **User Authentication & Subscriptions**
  - ** Submissions & Discussions**
  - **Reactive Read Service** for high-volume, non-blocking data retrieval
- **Asynchronous & Non-Blocking Reads**: Implemented **Spring WebFlux** to handle a **1000:1 read-to-write ratio**, improving responsiveness and concurrency.
- **Search Optimization**: Integrated **Elasticsearch** to enable fast search by **title, description, and metadata**, enhancing content discoverability.
- **Scalability with Spring Cloud**: Used **Netflix Eureka** for service discovery, allowing **horizontal scalability** across multiple instances.
- **Spring Security Integration**: Ensuring secure user authentication and API access control.

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Java, Spring Boot, Spring WebFlux, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA, Hibernate
- **Microservices**: Spring Cloud, Netflix Eureka
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Primary Database), Elasticsearch (Search Optimization), MongoDB (Document Database)
- **API Gateway**: Spring Cloud Gateway (for request routing and load balancing)
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with Spring Security
- **Infrastructure & Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes (future scope)

## Microservices Breakdown
| Service Name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **User Service** | Handles authentication, subscriptions, and user management |
| **Post Service** | Manages project submissions, discussions, and comments |
| **Read Service** | Optimized for high-volume, non-blocking reads using WebFlux |
| **Search Service** | Enables fast search and indexing with Elasticsearch |
| **API Gateway** | Routes requests to appropriate services & provides load balancing |
| **Service Discovery** | Netflix Eureka enables seamless service registration and discovery |
